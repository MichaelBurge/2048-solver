* Board/move representation
** 2048 = 2^11
** Since '2' is the smallest, it could also be 2^10.
** Store 10 16-bitsets, 5 32-bit, 3 64-bits.
* Be able to simulate games
* Algorithm
** We want to optimize for expected depth.
*** EV = probability * depth
*** EV(X)
= (EV(x1) + 1)/ n + (EV(x2)+1) / n ... EV(xn) / n
= sum(EV(xi)+1) / n
= avg(EV(xi) + 1)
= avg(EV(xi)) + 1
** Standard minimax
** Zobrist hashing(the meaning of the value V in the hash spot is "Real >= V")

** Tree pruning
*** We want the minimum number of penalty points. The penalty points are the
